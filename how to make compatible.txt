step 1: put the three actions in the mod.rules
make sure the paths are right (there are usually 4)
make sure the stat is replaced right
there may be more than three (see resource collector)

step 2: make the automation components
copy an existing one that has the right number of crew
copy the crew locations and prerequisites and priority from the part being modified
if it says crewlocations = [&../../crewlocation1/location] that's no good, you have to use numbers

!!REMEMBER!!
when in doubt, copy something that you already know works
